title: "Good Forgetfulness Test Scenario"
description: >
  This benchmark tests the system's ability to correctly prune used memories from the working memory
  while retaining unused recalled memories. The scenario involves recalling two memories, using one in
  the assistant's response, and ensuring only the used memory is forgotten.

memories:
  - timestamp: "2025-01-05T10:00:00"
    content: "I have two secret codes."
    role: user
    recalled: True

  - timestamp: "2025-01-05T10:00:09"
    role: user
    content: "the main secret code is 1235"
    recalled: True

  - timestamp: "2025-01-05T10:00:18"
    role: user
    content: "the secondary secret code is 9874"
    recalled: True

  - timestamp: "2025-01-05T10:00:23"
    role: assistant
    content: "Cool, I have stored both codes now."
    recalled: True

evaluations:
  - question: "Which code did I say was the main one?"
    references: "Memory for recalled code 1235 should NOT be present in recalled memories."
    type: "inspect"
    skip_recall: True
