title: "Good Forgetfulness Test Scenario"
description: >
  This benchmark tests the system's ability to correctly prune used memories from the working memory
  while retaining unused recalled memories. The scenario involves recalling two memories, using one in
  the assistant's response, and ensuring only the used memory is forgotten.
