title: "Temporal Memory Consolidation Test"
description: >
  This benchmark tests the system's ability to consolidate sequences of related messages
  into coherent summary memories. Rather than testing reasoning, it tests whether the
  system can recognize temporal patterns and group related messages into higher-level
  consolidated memories that capture complete narratives.
